2.Boot with compiled kernel and load bellow mentioned Driver on begalbone black for USB UDC support. 
	modprobe musb_dsps                    
	Note :  musb_dsps is dependent on musb_hdrc driver. 
	modprobe musb_am335x
	modprobe libcomposite     //Gadget driver 

3.Compile Driver sources and load one after another on BBB (BegalBone BLACK) and on Host 
   On BBB: 
	insmod led.ko
	insmod mslave.ko
   On Host: 
   	insmod  utest_slave.ko
Note : Please remove default driver (i.e usbtest) from host before loading  utest_slave.ko.

4. Testing and use case :
    
   For LED on : 
   	echo 1 > /sys/USB_TEST/usbled
   Result : Led should glow.
   For LED Off: 
   	echo 0 > /sys/USB_TEST/usbled
   Result: Led should off.
